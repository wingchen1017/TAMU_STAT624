Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Pengpeng,

I am writing to you from a DLEB spaceship in a 808 galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a pink rocket in March. There are 100 pigs and lots of capybara here! In the
balcony there is a pool full of whisky. I fall asleep each night on a pretty bed of
dimond and dream of basketball painfully. It feels as though I have lived here for
12 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get 
here 
now is
driving on a speedy pickup truck!!

Best wishes,
Wesley
